                                <h1 style="text-align: center;">HISTORY OF BAF</h1>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                            The origin of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) dates back to 1920 in British India when the Indian politicians demanded for inclusion of local people in the Royal Air Force because some members of Indian Royal Flying Core had earned name and fame in the 1st World War. The demand eventually got its shape in 1932 when Indian Air Force came into being on 08 October of that year. But until 1939 the Royal Air force hardly made any progress. Even during the 2nd World War period there was hardly any scope for training in the Bangladesh portion of the then sub-continent. However, airports were constructed in Comilla, Feni, Patenga, Cox’s Bazar and in few other places hastily. The only recruiting centre for this area was in Narayangonj.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">During 1951-52 the first fighter squadron of Pakistan was organized anew. It was commanded by Abdur Rahim Khan who became the Chief of Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force during 1969-71. Bengali PAF/AF officer Flight Lieutenant Towab was the Flight Commander of that squadron who later became Chief of Air Staff of independent Bangladesh in 1975. Of the Bengali pilots Flying Officer Alam died in plane crash in 1956. He Left behind his contemporary Flying Officer A K Khandker who later played a glorious role in our historic Liberation War. He was not only the Deputy Commander of the Bangladesh side in the Liberation War; he also represented Bangladesh side during the surrender of the occupation Force at Race Course Maidan (Now Suhrawardy Uddan) on 16 December 1971. It is worth mentioning that A K Khandker became the first Chief of Air Staff of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF).</p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">From 1947 to 1971 the Bengali nation had to struggle through the lives of myriad of people. The Bengali officers of the then Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had their name and sacrifice as well. Even during the Indo-Pak War in 1965, there were many glories of victory achieved by Shaheed (martyr) Squadron Leader Alam, Wing Commander Towab, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam and many others of them Flight lieutenant ( later on Group Captain) Saiful Azam became an ace fighter pilot. He showed success in three different countries in dog fight during real war. He became the only fighter pilot in the world who was awarded with state title by three different countries viz, Pakistan (Sitara-e-Jurat), Jordan (Hossam-e-Istiqlal) and Iraq (North S Suja). He proved his worthwhileness to such an extent that he was allowed to command a fighter squadron of Pakistan Air Force as a Flight Lieutenant which was supposed to be commanded by a Wing Commander. These officers had some praiseworthy airmen. One of them was Shaheed (martyr) Sergeant Zahurul Haque. He was a Ground Combat Instructor (GCI), a trade well known for conducting drill. Even such an airman had concern for his motherland. He was an accused in historic ‘Agartala Conspiracy Case’, obviously a historic plot to liberate the country. He succumbed to his injuries following constant torture on 15 February 1969. Bangladesh Air Force has recognized the contribution of this great airman since an important base of BAF (BAF Base Zahurul Haque) has been named in his name. Even the recognition has crossed the purview of BAF since a dormitory of Dhaka University has also been named after him.</p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">The glorious Liberation War took place in 1971. From the motivated drive of patristic zeal, a good number of Bengali officers and airmen including technicians renounced their previous services and joined the Liberation War to expedite victory. It was largely possible due to the sincerity of those members who established the Air Wing of the Liberation War on 28 September 1971 at Dimapur of Nagaland, India. The air wing possessed a scanty inventory of one DC-3 airplane, one Otter airplane and one Alluette helicopter. The patriotic pilots and technicians of the nascent Bangladesh Air Force formed a flying unit named, ‘Kilo Flight’ , under the able guidance of the then Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmud who later became Air Vice Marshal and Chief of Air Staff. However, the pilots of the historic ‘Kilo Flight’ made successful sorties to launch successful air attacks on a number of targets in Chittagong and Narayangonj. It was during the Liberation War that another great son of the soil, Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman sacrificed his life for his motherland. His sacrifice was not an ordinary one since it is difficult for a family man to endanger his life. It was not a fluke either. He not only sacrificed his life, but the happiness of his family life as well. While fleeing Pakistan with a T-33 aircraft to join the glorious Liberation War, he died at Thatta, a few kilometers away from the Indian border where his aircraft crashed. The heroic attempt has been rewarded by both BAF and the nation as well. The most important officers’ training base of BAF in Jessore has been named after him (BAF Base Matiur Rahman) and the nation has awarded him the highest state title, ‘Beershrestha’ Besides these great personalities, out of many, two more officers of BAF are worth mentioning, the two sector commanders. They are the then Squadron Leader Khademul Bashar who later became Air Vice Marshal and Chief of Air Staff and another officer is the then Squadron Leader Hamidullah who later became Wing Commander.</p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">Since independence, BAF underwent massive modification and expansion. Concentration has been given on both air power and air defense. Bases, Units and outposts have been established at different suitable places. As a mark of improvement, many foreign trainees both at officers and airmen levels underwent training in BAF. As a mark of recognition, Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) received ‘National Colours’ in 1980 by the then honorable President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Later Bangladesh Air Force Academy (BAFA) received ‘National colours’ in 2003 by the then honorable Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Even the Recruits’ Training School (RTS) has been awarded with ‘BAF Colours’ by an ex Chief of Air Staff in 2004.</p>
                        <p>
                        <p class="pb-4 text-justify">In aid to civil power, BAF always responded in the best possible way. Bangladesh Air Force performed tremendously during deluge like flood in 1988 and after a devastating cyclonic storm in Chittagong in 1991. It performed election duties quite successfully in 2001 Parliamentary Election. The organization also responded well in international requirements like after earthquake in Gujrat, India in 2001; after Tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in 2004 and after earthquake in Mujaffarabad, Pakistan in 2005. It has responded to the call of United Nations by serving under its umbrella in 17 different war-torn countries of the world.</p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Bir Sreshtho Flt Lt Matiur Rahman</h3>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Matiur Rahman was a Flight Lieutenant and a recipient of “Bir Sreshtho”, Bangladesh's highest military gallantry award for his utmost bravery during the Liberation War of Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Matiur Rahman was born on 29 October 1941 in 109, Old Dhaka Aga Sadek Road, in his ancestral houses "Mobarok Lodge". His father was Maulvi Abdus Samad and his mother was Syeda Khatun Mobarakunnesa. Among nine brothers and two sisters, Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman was the sixth. His family was a solvent and middle class educated family. Matiur Rahman was very good in sport and other co-curricular activities. He developed a very good team spirit and comradeship from the very school life.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">He completed his primary education at Dhaka Collegiate School. After that he was admitted into Pakistan Air Force School Sargodha in West Pakistan. On 15th August 1961, he joined Pakistan Air Force Academy (former Pakistan Air Force College) at Risalpur. On 22 June 1963, Matiur Rahman was commissioned as a Pilot Officer from the 36th GD(P) Course and was posted at No. 2 Squadron of Mauripur Air Base (now Masroor Air Base) at Karachi in West Pakistan. After that he successfully completed the Jet Conversion Training on T-33 jet trainers in that base. He successfully passed the course with a mark of 75.66% and was earmarked for Fighter Conversion Training. Fighter Conversion Training took place in F-86 Sabre Jets, this course he passed with a mark of 81%. He was posted in Peshawar (in No.19 Squadron) due to his bright result in the Fighter Conversion Course. His rank was Flying Officer during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. After the war, he went back to Sargodha to attend the Mig Conversion Course. He was promoted to the rank of Flight Lieutenant in 1967.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Matiur Rahman and his family went to Dhaka for a two-month vacation at the end of January, 1971. He was staying in the village of Ramanagar in Raypur during the military operation of 25 March 1971 conducted by the Pakistan army in the name of “Operation Searchlight”. Despite being a member of the PAF, Rahman opened a training camp in Vairab and started training Bengali people who were willing to join the Mukti Bahini. He formed a small defense force with the willing members and a few collected weapons. His camp was bombed by the PAF on 14 April 1971. But Rahman anticipated the attack beforehand and changed the place of his camp. Thus, his crew and he was saved from the bombing. Rahman returned to Dhaka on 23 April and then returned to Karachi on 9 May with his family.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">On 20 August, 1971 he attempted to hijack a T-33 trainer from Karachi, Pakistan to India in order to defect from the Pakistan Air Force and join the Liberation movement of Bangladesh. After taking the control of the plane, Rahman was flying it below the usual altitude to deceive the radar. However, Flt Lt Matiur Rahman could not take the plane out of Pakistani territory. The plane crashed in Thatta, 40 kilometres from the Indian border, because of the struggle to regain control of the plane by Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas. His body, which was found near the crash site, was buried at the military graveyard at Masroor Air Base. Matiur’s widow, Milly Rahman, and his two infant daughters were imprisoned for a month by Pakistan Air Force, and were released on September 29, 1971.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">After over 30 years of negotiations, Flight Lieutetant Matiur Rahman’s body was finally returned to Bangladesh on 24 June, 2006 for a ceremonial and highly symbolic reburial in 2006. He was buried at the Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard, in Mirpur, Dhaka, with full military honours. The Bangladesh Air Force's Air Base at Jashore is also named after him. BAF also gives out a trophy named after him for best performance in the flying training.</p>
